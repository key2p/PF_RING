- updated ixgbe driver to release 3.11.33
- Fixed bug that was causing ixgbe driver not to disable interrupts. This was causing
  a high load on the core handling the interrupts for ixgbe-based card
- libzero: various hugepages improvements and bug fixes
- Added ability to specify PF_RING_RX_PACKET_BOUNCE in pfring_open
- Fixed minor memory leak
- Various improvements to support of hardware timestamp on Silicom Intel-based 10 Gbit adapters
- DNA Bouncer: added direction to pfring_dna_bouncer_decision_func callback (useful in bidirectional mode)
- DNA Cluster: added dna_cluster_set_hugepages_mountpoint() to manually select the hugepages mount point when several are available
- Created architecture specific versions of libzero/DNA for exploiting latest generation of CPUs and thus improve performance
- Update PF_RING-aware igb update (4.0.17)
- Added pf_ring calls to pcap apps
